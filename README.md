# python-puzzles
Repository for Python code for puzzles and problems involving algorithms and data structures.

This repo is structured as follows :

A directory is created for every problem.

python-puzzles/[problem]

Each problem directory has the following files :

readme.txt : Brief problem statement and any accompanying example.

implementation.py : The Python script which provides the solution.

Every implementation.py file starts with the following comment :

Implementation of python-puzzles/[problem]

This structure ensures modularity while ensuring that in the event the Python scripts are moved elsewhere, it is possible to find out their source.
Structure may evolve as implementations grow.
