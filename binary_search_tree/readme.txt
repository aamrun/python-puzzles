Write a class for a binary search tree and provide the following operations :

Insert a node
Build the tree from a list
Inorder traversal
Preorder traversal
Postorder traversal

This class will be expanded and branched off into other implementations such as AVL trees, Red-Black trees, Ternary trees etc.
